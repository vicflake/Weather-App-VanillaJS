# Weather-App

Weather application developed through the SheCodes Plus workshop.

Technologies used HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

During the course, we had to develop the Wireframe for the initial design and develop the app from there.

The application includes external API and Geolocation to provide real time weather in the selected city.
